Transfer (author - client):

AtAa    transfer

Delegation/Undelegation:

AtAa    delegate amount to node
AtAa    undelegate amount from node (author - delegate)
AtAa    undelegate amount from node (author - node)
AtAwa   undelegate all from node (author - delegate)
AtAwa   undelegate all from node (author - node)
Gwa     undelegate all from all nodes (author - delegate)

Freeze/Unfreeze:

Ga      freeze amount
Ga      unfreeze amount
Gwa     unfreeze all



Node registration (author - client or node):
GwaTd   register current node host (data - IP, port, name, opt - previous node host) - must worked as client, must have 'node alive check'-transaction



Node status (author - node):
GwaTd   node alive check (data - IP, port)
GwaTd   register future node host (data - IP, port, current node host) - must worked as client, must be checked twice
GaTd    wanna be node (amount  - freeze, data - node type) - signer put transaction in block, if aspirant really can be node (but node need have delegations)
GwaTd   start node (data - node type) - signer put transaction in block, if aspirant really can be node (have delegations)
GaTd    short stop node (amount - additional freeze, will be pay for every block, data - max time of stopping)
Gwa     long or forever stop node (automatically unfrozen and undelegation all)



Node status (author - signer):
AtAwa   node alive check directive (data - IP, port, node address)
node type approved (data - node type) - only after this node can work as node, signer put it after "start node" transaction


GwaTd   set allower                       allower can set/unset allow modes and allows for nodes
GwaTd   unsetset allower                  allower can set/unset allow modes and allows for nodes

set/unset allow mode to M-nodes         if set - only allowed addresses can be M-nodes
set/unset allow mode to S-nodes         if set - only allowed addresses can be S-nodes
allow/deny address to be node M
allow/deny address to be node S
lock/unlock address to transfer              (to, ~amount)

remove transaction from mempool
