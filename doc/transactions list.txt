Transfer:

AtAa    transfer


Delegation/Undelegation:

AtAa    delegate amount to node
AtAa    undelegate amount from node (author - delegate)
AtAa    undelegate amount from node (author - node)
AtAwa   undelegate all from node (author - delegate)
AtAwa   undelegate all from node (author - node)
Gwa     undelegate all from all nodes (author - delegate)

Freeze/Unfreeze:

Ga      freeze amount
Ga      unfreeze amount
Gwa     unfreeze all


Node status (author - node):
GwaTd   wanna be F-node (amount - freeze, data - node type) - signer put transaction in block, if aspirant really can be node (but node need have delegations)
GaTd    wanna be node (amount  - freeze, data - node type) - signer put transaction in block, if aspirant really can be node (but node need have delegations)
GwaTd   start node (data - node type) - signer put transaction in block, if aspirant really can be node (have delegations)
GaTd    short stop node (amount - additional freeze, will be pay for every block, data - max time of stopping)
Gwa     long or forever stop node (automatically unfrozen and undelegation all)

Node status (author - signer):


GwaTd   set allower                       allower can set/unset allow modes and allows for nodes
GwaTd   unsetset allower                  allower can set/unset allow modes and allows for nodes

set/unset allow mode to M-nodes         if set - only allowed addresses can be M-nodes
set/unset allow mode to S-nodes         if set - only allowed addresses can be S-nodes
allow/deny address to be node M
allow/deny address to be node S
lock/unlock address to transfer              (to, ~amount)
