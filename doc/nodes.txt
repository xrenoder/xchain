7    main node (M-node)
0111
                1st level
                heart of network, create and keep critical network data

                create & sign mainchain blocks & all base sidechains blocks
                store mainchain & all base sidechains
                manage S-nodes for other sidechains storing
                communicate with other blockchains for exchange X-coins to other coins

                30% of transaction reward

                need for tests 2 M-nodes
                need for start 2 M-nodes
                optimal 8 M-nodes
                connected with own pool of S-nodes, with all other M-nodes, if one of M-nodes not worked - connect with their S-nodes
                must be connected to BTC-network
                must have own X capital + delegated Y capital
                must have hi-perf CPU & good channel

    6   master-aspirant node (MA-node) "I wanna be M-node!"
    0110
                must work as S-node
                must be connected to BTC-network
                must have own X capital + delegated Y capital
                must have hi-perf CPU & good channel
                sometimes work and tested as master node (if S-nodes reached optimal count)

5    side node (S-node)
0101
                2nd level
                wheelhorse of network: create & keep utility network data

                create & sign utility sidechains blocks
                store utility sidechains
                optional store mainchain & all base sidechains

                30% of transaction reward

                need for tests 2 S-nodes for network (1 S-node per 1 M-node)
                need for start 4 S-nodes for network (2 S-nodes per 1 M-node)
                optimal 64 S-nodes (8 per 1 M-node)
                middle level of network
                connected with own F-nodes and with one own M-node, if own M-node not worked - connect with other M-node

    4   side-aspirant node (SA-node)
    0100
                must work as P-node

3   Proxy node (P-node)
0011

                30% of transaction reward

    2   proxy-aspirant node (PA-node)
